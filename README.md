# Project Features
1.Vehicle Detection:

  Implements YOLO for real-time detection of vehicles.

  Optimized for accuracy and speed.

2.Counting:

  Counts detected vehicles frame-by-frame or image-by-image.

3.Custom Dataset Support:

  Training and evaluation on custom datasets with user-defined configurations.

# Results
The project outputs annotated images/videos with detected vehicles and counts.

Logs include performance metrics for evaluation.

# Purpose

This project serves as a resource for students and researchers interested in applying YOLO-based methods for vehicle detection and counting. It provides a practical example of integrating computer vision with real-world applications.
